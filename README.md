Weather App on freecodecamp

This weather app uses an API to call coordinates of the user's location and then uses those coordinates to call a Weather API.

User Story: I can see the weather in my current location.
User Story: I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
User Story: I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
